# Random Password Generator

The purpose for this application is to generate a random password based on user criteria. To achieve this I have included a responsive user interface with HTML and CSS (Bootstrap), along with Javscript to handle user input and the random generation. 


*As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria, so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security*

## Business Context

For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

*"Given that a user needs a new and secure password. When prompted for password criteria. Then a password is generated."*
